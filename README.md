# chess
A simple chess game written in C++. It uses the SFML library for graphics. It is a work in progress.
It is currently playable, but there are still some bugs and missing features.
It eventually will be able to play against a computer opponent. And it will be able to tell
you how good your moves are. Going to use different algorithms to build the AI.
